# Mastering The Game Of Go *From Scratch*


Downloading the repositry:
1. git clone https://github.com/MWPainter/cs234-mastering-the-game-of-go-from-scratch.git

Downloading submodules (once the main repo exists):
1. git submodule init
2. git submodule update

To do both of the above in one command, run:
1. git clone --recursive https://github.com/MWPainter/cs234-mastering-the-game-of-go-from-scratch.git

To commit to both the gym submodule and main repositry, simply commit as normal in the main repositry. And push a normal. Commits can be made and pushed from the 'gym' directory if you wish to only update the forked repositry, and not the main repositry.
